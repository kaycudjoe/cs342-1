I will be making a database to store details of event organization and billing for sub-orgainizations within Calvin College. I am a leader of Sexuality and Gender Awareness focusing on event planning and miscellaneous materials procurement, and a database like this would assist me in keeping within budget and planning an event. It would also assist Catering Services and Building Services with scheduling and Calvin orgainizations with billing.  
The database will cover events, their location, catering, and setup, organizers, their orgainizations, the orgainization's treasurer, and miscellaneous items needed for the event.
