Work through the following materials this week:
Read Pramod Sadalage’s NoSQL Databases: An Overview (circa 2012) and explain:
the key motivations for considering non-relational database systems.
	Impedence Mismatch
	Encapsulation of databases with apps
	Web platform popularity
aggregate data models.
	A collection of data interacted with as units
polyglot persistence.
	The use of multiple data storage technologies to store data.
the relevance of the CAP theorem.
	A system cannot deliver more than two of consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.
the types of NoSQL databases.
	Key-Value Databases - Client can get either value for the key, put a value for a key, or delete key.
    Document Databases - Database that stores and retrieves documents which can be XML, JSON, BSON, etc.
    Column Family Databases - Database that stores data in column families as rows that have many columns associated with a row key.
    Graph Databases - Allows the user to store entities and relationships between nodes.
when (and when not) to use NoSQL database systems.
	Use NoSQL if you want to improve programmer productivity and improve data access performance.
    Do not use NoSQL is there are many different entities or when there is very complex relations.
An alternate source of this basic information is Martin Fowler’s Introduction to NoSQL video.
Use “Getting Started with the Key/Value API”, Chapters 3–5, from the Oracle NoSQL Database documentation as a reference. Be sure to know how to:
Compare and contrast Major and minor key components.
	Major Key - Identifies the entity and is the leading components of the key.
    Minor Key - Other components of the key.
Use the appropriate commands to write and retrieve records.
