a. What type of noSQL database system is Oracle’s NoSQL product, KVLite?
	*KV*Lite is a *K*ey-*V*alue database system.
b. The Internet Movie DataBase (imdb.com) is currently implemented in mySQL. If you were required to port it to a noSQL system, which of the noSQL system types would you suggest? Explain your answer.
	If Oracle's mySQL is already owned, it would seem that switching to Oracle's noSQL would require the least amount of cost as the supplier would be consistent. Otherwise using a free, open-source, well-known, well-documented noSQL system would be preferable, something like mongoDB or Cassandra.
c. Could you (efficiently) reuse the same key-value structure for exercise 13.1.d (above) and its “opposite”, i.e., get the movies in which a given actor is cast? Why or why not?
	That kind of an exercise would require switching the keys and values, so the structure would have to change.
d. NoSQL databases are often referred to as schema-less or schema-free. Explain what this means using examples from your homework solution.
	Schema-less/free refers to the lack of a rigid schema structure. These databases store data as key-value pairs or JSON documents.  We use key-value pairs, which means that our key can refer to any type of data, and they do not all have to be the same type.  In my code I define my ArrayLists, creating a constraint on the types of data allowed in.  For Roles, for example, my definition of the ArrayList array defined the role of an actor in a movie to be a string.  Since this type restriction is imposed by the code and not as an inherent property of the database, it is said to be schema-free, also known as schema-less.
