-- The original IMDB Movie table included fields for both score and votes. Can you add a constraint (using the mechanisms we’ve studied) the requires that all movies -- having a non-NULL score value must also have more than 1000 votes? If so, explain what constraint you’d specify; if not, include an explanation of why it’s not -- possible.

-- Add
CHECK ((score IS NULL) OR (votes > 1000));
-- to the Movie table, basically just make a compound argument for the CHECK constraint.

-- Database systems, including Oracle, allow DBAs to create separate constraints that are set on given tables, which allows DBAs to turn constraints off and on during database operations, e.g.:

ALTER TABLE tableName
    ADD CONSTRAINT constraintName
    someConstraint;
-- Can you imagine when, if ever, you might want to separate a constraint from the table definition it modifies? If so, describe the circumstances; if not, explain why not.

-- This reminds me of setting global variables, if a constraint is ever possibly going to be changed adding them in one place is going to be the most convenient, especially if the database consists of many tables.
