1. Basic SQL (Section 6.3) — Review basic SQL as needed, then write sample queries that:
  a. Use one or more tuple variables (Section 6.3.2).
    SELECT M.title, M.year FROM Movie M, Performer P, Casting C 
      WHERE M.id=C.movieId AND P.id=M.performerId AND P.id=2;

  b. Use one or more of the set operations, e.g., UNION, EXCEPT, INTERSECT (Section 6.3.4).
    SELECT P.firstName, P.lastName FROM Performer P, Casting C WHERE P.id = 1
      EXCEPT
      SELECT P.firstName, P.lastName FROM Performer P, Casting C WHERE C.movieId = 2;

2. Advanced SQL (Sections 7.1.1–7.1.5) — This will include more new material; write sample queries that:
  a. Select based on a NULL field value (Section 7.1.1).
    SELECT title FROM Movie WHERE score IS NULL;

  b. Implement a nested sub-query, using [NOT] EXISTS, IN, ANY or ALL (Sections 7.1.2–7.1.4).
    SELECT firstName, lastName FROM Performer P 
      WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Casting C WHERE P.id = Casting.performerID);

  c. Implement a correlated sub-query (Section 7.1.3).
    SELECT firstName, lastName FROM Performer P 
      WHERE id = (SELECT C.performerId FROM Casting C WHERE C.performerId = P.id);
