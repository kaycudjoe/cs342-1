Consider the following parallel schedule. What do you expect will happen at each step? and then run through the schedule to check your intuition.

Session 1										Session 2				Comments
Query the movie table.							Query the movie table.	These better be the same!  They are.
Delete a movie and query the modified table.	repeat the query…		Note that Ocean’s 11 (#238071) has no role parents, so it’s a good movie to delete.  Must commit in order to register the delete, must commit after queries.
Rollback and query.								repeat…	 				Delete without commit works but doesn't register on the second session, rollback then commit changes nothing as expected.
Add a new movie and query.						repeat…	 				Works with commit
Commit.											repeat…	 				Commit is necessary to see work on the other session.
Now, manually run the schedule in two parallel SQL*Plus sessions and check to see if your expections were correct.
They were

Experiment a bit with some SQL*Plus sessions, making changes, exiting and restarting the session and then answer the following questions.
    a. Does Oracle handle the transaction life-cycle (see Figure 20.4) with respect to starting and stopping SQL*Plus sessions?
		Yes.
    b. Can we implement any of the ACID properties using START-TRANSACTION/SAVEPOINT/ROLLBACK/COMMIT?
		No, without locking ACID cannot be fully implemented.
