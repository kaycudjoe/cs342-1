Exercise 1.14

Complete the exercise as written.

Consider Figure 1.2.
a. If the name of the ‘CS’ (Computer Science) Department changes to
‘CSSE’ (Computer Science and Software Engineering) Department and
the corresponding prefix for the course number also changes, identify the
columns in the database that would need to be updated.

	Student Major, Course Department, Course Course_number, Section Course_number, Prerequisite Course_number, Prerequisite Prerequisite_Number

b. Can you restructure the columns in the COURSE, SECTION, and
PREREQUISITE tables so that only one column will need to be updated?

	Instead of Department being a few letters, assign every department a unique id number that does not change with the name of the department and prepend it to the numeric values of Course-number.  Then the only column that will need to be updated is Student Major, if that.

In addition, consider whether you can restructure the schema so that only one field needs to be changed. If it’s possible, explain how. If not, explain why not.

	Without redefining what a course number looks like it wouldn't be possible, in order to represent prerequisites two columns would have to be changed in order to accommodate CS changing to CSSE.
