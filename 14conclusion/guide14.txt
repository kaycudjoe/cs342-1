Work through the following materials this week:

Read Section 30.1:
Name and explain the for kinds of control measures required for database security.
	Access control: Security system must include ways to restrict access
	Inference control: Don't allow queries that could infer information about an individual.				
	Flow control: Don't allow data to reach those who are unauthorized to use it.
	Data encryption: Encode data so that it can't be intercepted.
Compare and contrast information security and information privacy.
	Information security involves protecting a system from unathorized use using user authentication, information encryption, access control, firewall policies, and intrusion detection.
	Information Privacy is information security plus responsible use as specified by the information provider.
